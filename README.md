# canihazmidi

The aim of this project is to create a portable stand-alone device which can convert a Pro DJ Link clock to a MIDI-Clock signal thus making it possible to synchronize MIDI capable instruments with Pioneer DJ equipment.

## Status

The project is currently in the concept phase. Following vaguely defined milestones need to be reached:

- [ ] Write a prototype clock converter software on PC to learn the protocols (MIDI, Pro DJ Link)
- [ ] Specify a suitable embedded hardware platform 
- [ ] Port the prototype software to the target platform

## Contributing

Feel free to join! Any input is welcome. This is my first hardware/embedded project and I am looking forward to learn a lot in the process.
